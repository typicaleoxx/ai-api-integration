## AI API Integration

This project demonstrates a minimal integration with an AI API for prompt based text generation.

This project shows how to connect to an AI API in a simple and secure way. It loads the API key from an environment file, sets up the client, sends a prompt to the model, and prints the generated response. The goal is to keep the setup clean, making it easy to understand how AI services can be integrated into an application.

## Features

- Secure API key handling using environment variables
- Basic prompt submission
- Text generation response handling
